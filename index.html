        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>When I "enrolled" in SNHU's Computer Science degree, I had no idea how much it would change my thinking and capabilities. This portfolio depicts my transformation from an inexperienced novice to a confident full-stack developer. Late nights debugging, "aha" moments when complicated concepts crystallized, and collaborative projects that taught me the value of varied viewpoints - all contributed to my development.</p>
            
            <p>What I find most exciting about computer science is how it combines creativity with technical skills. Whether I am designing database structures or building user interfaces, I've learned that good software needs both logical thinking and creative ideas. My focus is always on writing clear and easy-to-maintain code, while keeping in mind the people who will use what I create.</p>

        <h2>The Story Behind My Travlr Getaways Project</h2>
        <p>The Travlr Getaways travel booking system began as a simple classroom assignment in CS 465, but through enhancements, it evolved into something much more substantial. I remember the first version—basic HTML pages with hardcoded trip data. It worked, but with each new enhancement it became so much more.</p>
        
        <p>I chose to feature this project because it perfectly captures my growth as a developer. The enhancements that were implemented represent key milestones in my learning:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> Moving from static JSON files to a real MongoDB database taught me the importance of proper data modeling. I spent hours refining my Mongoose schemas to ensure they could handle real-world travel data.</li>
            <li><strong>API Development:</strong> Building the RESTful API endpoints was like learning a new language—figuring out how the frontend and backend should communicate. I'll never forget the satisfaction when my first successful API call returned actual trip data from the database.</li>
            <li><strong>Single Page Application:</strong> Converting to an Angular SPA challenged me to think differently about user experience. Watching the interface become more responsive and dynamic was incredibly rewarding.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Implementation:</strong> Adding authentication was my "aha" moment of application security. Implementing JWT tokens made me appreciate how careful we must be with user data.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>This project taught me that good software development is iterative. My first attempts at some features didn't work as planned, but each challenge became a learning opportunity. For example, when I initially implemented the authentication system, I struggled with token expiration. Through research and experimentation, I found a solution that was both secure and user-friendly.</p>
        
        <p>Perhaps most importantly, I learned the value of writing code that others can understand and maintain. My early versions worked but weren't always clear. Through code reviews and refactoring, I developed a style that balances efficiency with readability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Demonstrating My Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> The project's architecture evolved significantly from simple server-rendered pages to a modern component-based Angular frontend with a dedicated API backend. This taught me the importance of separation of concerns and modular design.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures:</strong> Working with the trip data helped me understand how different data structures impact performance. I optimized queries and implemented efficient data transformations to ensure smooth user experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> Designing the MongoDB schemas gave me hands-on experience with NoSQL databases. I learned how to structure documents for both performance and flexibility—valuable skills for any real-world application.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>As I complete my degree, I'm excited to apply these skills in professional settings. This project proved to me that I can take a basic concept and transform it into a robust application. More importantly, it showed me how much I enjoy the problem-solving aspects of development.</p>
        
        <p>I'm particularly proud of how the authentication system turned out. Implementing proper security practices gave me confidence that I can build applications that protect user data, which is a crucial skill in today's digital landscape.</p>
        
        <p>However, this project wasn't without its challenges. I spent hours and hours troubleshooting, debugging, and fine-tuning various functionalities to ensure they worked properly. The process taught me patience and resilience, pushing me to dig deeper into my problem-solving toolkit.</p>
        
        <p>This portfolio represents my journey, but it's just the beginning. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow as I take on new challenges in my career. The Travlr Getaways project will always remind me how far I've come—from simple HTML pages to full-stack applications with proper security and database integration.</p>
